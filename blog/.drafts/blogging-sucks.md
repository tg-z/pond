## blogging sucks..kinda

feb 24, 2020  

sometimes i wonder how dev bloggers have it in them to maintain posting
on their website. does it have to do with their time management? to be
honest, i don't know. whatever it is they possess that allows them to
stay consistent and helpful, i know i don't have.

i want to atleast try to keep a blog, whether it isn't as consistent as
the ones i read, hopefully it helps someone out there reading it. i dont
expect many people to read my blog, but i'll welcome anyone who cares
enough to pay attention.

although blogging isn't really my thing (yet), i do read some people's
and i often take interest in whatever they end up writing about, tech
related or not.

recently, i've really enjoyed watching [luke
smith's](https://lukesmith.xyz) channel on youtube in my free time. he
does a really good job at getting to the point and giving meaning to the
content he puts out. his humor is sardonic and his subscribers love how
little he seems to care about his channel, while still having strong
opinions about the state of tech.
