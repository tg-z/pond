## export your periscope data

feb 09, 2021  

If you haven't already heard the news, [Twitter will be discontinuing
Periscope](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/periscope-faq) this
year in 2021. If you have an account on Periscope I recommend backing up
your data before it is too late, regardless of how often you use it.

1.  In order to get your data, log into your account at
    [https://www.pscp.tv](https://www.pscp.tv/).
2.  Go to <https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data> and click 'Send Data
    Request'
3.  Once you've requested your data, your dashboard should look
    something like this:

![your periscope
data](https://gist.github.com/tg-z/de7a474b30838842ddf390e354f73450/raw/b1cd5e00396a3b45e824433ece2f5308de2358c5/your_periscope_data.svg)  

Now it's only a matter of time before your data is ready for
downloading. You can close this tab and reopen it when it's ready. Your
request will not be cancelled if you close the tab.

For easy access to periscope, you can visit [Your Periscope
Broadcasts](https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data/broadcasts) and [Your
Periscope Data](https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data/).

If you've done more than watch livestreams on periscope you must repeat
the process by going to [Your Periscope
Broadcasts](https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data/broadcasts) and
clicking 'Send Data Request'. This will prepare the actual contents of
your livestreams for downloading.
