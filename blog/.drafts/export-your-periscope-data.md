## export your periscope data

feb 09, 2021

If you haven't already heard the news, [Twitter will be discontinuing Periscope](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/periscope-faq) this year in 2021. If you have an account on Periscope I recommend backing up your data before it is too late, regardless of how often you use it.

1. In order to get your data, log into your account at [https://www.pscp.tv](https://www.pscp.tv/).
2. Go to [https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data](https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data) and click 'Send Data Request'
3. Once you've requested your data, your dashboard should look something like this:

Now it's only a matter of time before your data is ready for downloading. You can close this tab and reopen it when it's ready. Your request will not be cancelled if you close the tab.
