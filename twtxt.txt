2020-08-05T22:22:10-07:00	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> (re: mastodon + twtxt crossposter) hey, ive been meaning to do this too, but i haven't used txtnish. i currently use twet (https://github.com/quite/twet) which is coded in go. i think im going to migrate to txtnish because im more comfortable with shell scripting. do you have your txtnish config hosted somewhere for reference? thanks :)
