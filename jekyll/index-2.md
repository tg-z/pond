### last updated: {{ 'now' | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

welcome to my space on the internet. i want this website to be used for positive change. whether or not you do something with the information on this site is up to you. please take time to learn how to be an ally and educate yourself on important issues.

right now it might seem convenient and easy to distract yourself from the reality of the world, but remember to question everything and demand justice for those who've been wronged. aknowledge the privilege that you have and use it to fight oppression and discrimination.

also see the [library](https://pond.computer/library.html) to read some texts.
