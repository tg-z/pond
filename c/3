bye bye, big tech

hi, i think a lot about privacy on and offline. i want to get to
a place where i no longer depend on products of mass consumption from
FAANG (facebook,apple,amazon,netflix,google/alphabet). ive been slowly
exporting my data from facebook, instagram, google, and fitbit and 
backing it all up to prepare for when i actually "delete" my accounts. 
unfortunately thats all i can do because a majority of these companies
are known to store users data on their servers for years. the cloud
scares me. the control i have over my own data almost makes me feel
hopeless in the fight for privacy + security. but i wont let it stop
me from doing everything i can to protect myself on the internet.
right now, i am nowhere near reaching my goal and ive faced 
several challenges in the process. my plan goes something like this...
