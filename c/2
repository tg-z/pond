	[4mwtf is a clog?[0m

	a clog is a tiny blog that is meant to be read in the terminal using the 
	curl command. If you want to start your own clog simplyfollow these steps:

	1) copy this clog directory to the root of your website.
	2) delete this post (remove the line in index for it too).
	3) run new.sh to create a new post.

	that's it, your clog will be viewable at:

	curl -s www.yourwebsite.com/clog/index

	you can add any introduction text you want before the "posts:" line in index.
	everything after "posts:" should be a line referencing a post.
	
	enjoy!
